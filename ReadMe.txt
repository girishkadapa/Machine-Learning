
This project aims to experiement the Different Machine learning models on the dataset and compare each of them.
Note:Please place all the dataset files in the current folder where the execution files are placed.

-> To execute Simply run Classification.py

For Classification:
There are couple of datasets that took training time more than 3 minutes.
So Its failed.But we trained it for longer time and mentioned the data in the report.
1. Adults_Salary - KNN
2. steel_plates_faults - Neural Networks
3. Credit card - SVM and Neural Network  


For regression please execute Regression.py
There are couple of datasets that took training time more than 3 minutes.
So Its failed.But we trained it for longer time and mentioned the data in the report.
-> Bike Sharing - SVM()
-> Molecular Challenge - Neural Network and Gaussian Process

CNN:
-> To Execute the file please keep all the batch file in same direcrtory
-> To train just run the CNN.py
-> There is also a model that is trained is being provided. 
-> If it needs to be loaded then comment out the training part and only execute the accuracy part.
-> Activation Maximization step is being done and images are provided for each of the classes in the folder.


Report:

Both the PDF and the tex file along with the images are being provided.
